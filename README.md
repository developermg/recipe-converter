# recipe-converter
The Recipe Converter application uses converts a recipe to the desired serving size. Because it utilizes a single text area for the ingredients list, the application uses Regex to recognize the measurements, in order to return the resized recipe with kitchen standard measurements.  
For example, quartering a recipe that calls for *1/3 c sugar* will yield *1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon*.
